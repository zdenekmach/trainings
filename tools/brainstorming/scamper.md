# SCAMPER

## Overview
SCAMPER is a creative thinking technique that uses seven prompts to generate ideas for improving or innovating on existing products, services, or processes. Each letter represents a different type of modification.

## When to Use

### Ideal Situations
- **Product improvement**: Enhancing existing offerings
- **Innovation workshops**: Generating new product concepts
- **Process optimization**: Finding better ways to do things
- **Problem-solving**: When direct solutions aren't obvious
- **Competitive differentiation**: Finding unique angles
- **Marketing campaigns**: Creating creative approaches
- **Service design**: Reimagining customer experiences

### Not Recommended For
- Completely new inventions (works best with existing base)
- When constraints are very rigid
- Emergency situations requiring immediate solutions

## The SCAMPER Prompts

### S - Substitute
**What can you substitute or replace?**
- Materials, ingredients, components
- People, roles, processes
- Rules, assumptions
- Location, time

**Questions:**
- What materials/resources could you swap?
- What if we used X instead of Y?
- What other process could work?
- What if different people did this?

**Example**: Butter → Olive oil in recipes (substitute ingredient)

### C - Combine
**What can you combine or merge?**
- Combine features, products, or services
- Merge processes or teams
- Blend ideas, purposes, or appeals
- Integrate technologies

**Questions:**
- What could we merge with this?
- What if we combined X and Y?
- How could we integrate these features?
- What complementary elements could join?

**Example**: Phone + Camera + Internet = Smartphone (combine devices)

### A - Adapt
**What can you adapt or adjust?**
- Adapt ideas from other contexts
- Adjust to fit different uses
- Alter to suit new conditions
- What else is like this?

**Questions:**
- What could we copy or adapt from elsewhere?
- What other ideas does this suggest?
- What could we learn from similar situations?
- How has history solved similar problems?

**Example**: Velcro adapted from burrs sticking to dog fur

### M - Modify/Magnify/Minify
**What can you change, enlarge, or reduce?**
- Change attributes (color, shape, motion, sound)
- Magnify: make bigger, stronger, longer, thicker
- Minify: make smaller, lighter, shorter, faster
- Change meaning, function, or perception

**Questions:**
- What if this were bigger/smaller?
- What could we exaggerate or understate?
- What if we changed the shape/color/texture?
- Can we make it faster/slower?

**Example**: Mini Cooper (minify regular car), Supersize meal (magnify portion)

### P - Put to Another Use
**What other uses or purposes?**
- New ways to use as-is
- Modified for different markets
- Different contexts or users
- Secondary purposes

**Questions:**
- What else could this be used for?
- Who else could use this?
- How could we use this in a different context?
- What if users behaved differently?

**Example**: Baking soda → deodorizer, cleaner, toothpaste (not just baking)

### E - Eliminate
**What can you remove or simplify?**
- Remove features, steps, or components
- Simplify processes
- Strip down to essentials
- Reduce complexity

**Questions:**
- What if we removed this feature/step?
- What's not absolutely necessary?
- Can we simplify this?
- What would happen if we did nothing?

**Example**: Google homepage eliminates everything except search box

### R - Reverse/Rearrange
**What can you reverse or reorder?**
- Reverse process, sequence, or roles
- Rearrange components or layout
- Turn inside out or upside down
- Change perspective or direction

**Questions:**
- What if we did this backwards?
- What if we reversed roles?
- Can we change the sequence?
- What if we turned this upside down?

**Example**: Reverse auction (buyer sets price, sellers compete to lower)

## How to Use

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify Subject**
   - What product/service/process are you working with?
   - Example: "Our mobile app onboarding process"

2. **Go Through Each Letter Systematically**
   - Work through S-C-A-M-P-E-R one by one
   - Generate multiple ideas per prompt
   - Don't filter yet—quantity over quality

3. **S - Substitute Brainstorm**
   - "What could we substitute in the onboarding?"
   - Substitute video tutorials for text, gamification for traditional forms, etc.

4. **C - Combine Brainstorm**
   - "What could we combine?"
   - Combine onboarding with first real task, merge steps, integrate social proof

5. **A - Adapt Brainstorm**
   - "What can we adapt from other apps/industries?"
   - Adapt gaming progression, dating app swipe patterns, banking security methods

6. **M - Modify Brainstorm**
   - "What could we make bigger/smaller/different?"
   - Magnify rewards, minify steps, change timing or visual style

7. **P - Put to Another Use**
   - "What other purposes could onboarding serve?"
   - Also collect user preferences, become a tutorial they return to, community building

8. **E - Eliminate Brainstorm**
   - "What can we remove?"
   - Eliminate account creation, remove unnecessary forms, skip non-critical steps

9. **R - Reverse/Rearrange**
   - "What if we reversed or reordered things?"
   - Start with results first, reverse typical flow, rearrange step sequence

10. **Review and Refine**
    - Look at all ideas generated
    - Combine complementary ideas
    - Select most promising for development

## Tips for Success
- **Don't skip prompts**: Even if one seems irrelevant, try it
- **Quantity first**: Generate many ideas before judging
- **Build on ideas**: Use one SCAMPER prompt to inspire another
- **Visual aids**: Sketch or prototype ideas as you generate
- **Time-box**: Spend 5 minutes per letter minimum
- **Combine prompts**: Best ideas often combine multiple SCAMPER elements
- **Real examples**: Look at actual products/services for inspiration

## Common Pitfalls
- **Too quick**: Rushing through prompts without deep exploration
- **Early filtering**: Judging ideas too quickly kills creativity
- **Vague ideas**: "Make it better" isn't specific enough
- **Skipping difficult prompts**: "Eliminate" and "Reverse" are often skipped but valuable
- **Solo use**: SCAMPER works better with diverse group
- **No follow-through**: Generating ideas but not developing them

## Combining with Other Methods
- **SCAMPER + Mind Mapping**: Use mind map to organize SCAMPER ideas
- **SCAMPER + Six Thinking Hats**: Generate with SCAMPER (Green Hat), then evaluate (Yellow/Black Hats)
- **SCAMPER + Prototyping**: Quickly prototype SCAMPER ideas to test

## Key Insight
> "SCAMPER provides the questions; you provide the answers."

Creative thinking isn't magic—it's systematic questioning from different angles. SCAMPER gives you the angles; your knowledge of the domain provides the insights.
