# Starbursting

## Overview
Starbursting is a brainstorming technique focused on generating questions rather than answers. It uses the six fundamental questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How) to systematically explore all aspects of an idea or problem.

## When to Use

### Ideal Situations
- **New product/project ideation**: Before development begins
- **Problem exploration**: When you need to understand a problem deeply
- **Due diligence**: Before committing to a decision
- **Requirements gathering**: When planning projects
- **Risk identification**: Finding what you don't know
- **Stakeholder analysis**: Understanding all perspectives
- **Strategic planning**: Comprehensive situation analysis

### Not Recommended For
- When you need answers immediately, not questions
- Simple, well-understood problems
- When team is already overwhelmed with uncertainty
- Emergency situations requiring quick decisions

## How to Use

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Place Idea/Problem in Center**
   - Write the concept, product, or problem in the middle
   - Draw a star around it (6 points for 6 question types)
   - Example: "Launch new subscription service"

2. **Label Star Points with 5W+H**
   - Each point of the star represents one question type:
     - Who?
     - What?
     - Where?
     - When?
     - Why?
     - How?

3. **Generate Questions for Each Point**
   - Spend time on each question type
   - Generate as many questions as possible
   - Don't try to answer yet—just questions
   - Aim for 10-20 questions per category

4. **WHO Questions**
   - Who are the users/customers?
   - Who are the stakeholders?
   - Who will implement this?
   - Who benefits? Who is harmed?
   - Who are the competitors?
   - Who has done this before?
   - Who needs to approve?
   - Who might oppose this?

5. **WHAT Questions**
   - What is the core offering?
   - What problem does this solve?
   - What are the features?
   - What resources are needed?
   - What are the alternatives?
   - What could go wrong?
   - What success looks like?
   - What assumptions are we making?

6. **WHERE Questions**
   - Where will this be used?
   - Where will it be available?
   - Where in the customer journey?
   - Where do we focus first?
   - Where are the opportunities?
   - Where are similar solutions?
   - Where should we avoid?

7. **WHEN Questions**
   - When will we launch?
   - When do customers need this?
   - When should we start?
   - When is break-even?
   - When do we iterate?
   - When is market timing right?
   - When should we stop?

8. **WHY Questions**
   - Why does this matter?
   - Why now?
   - Why us?
   - Why would customers choose this?
   - Why might it fail?
   - Why these features?
   - Why this strategy?

9. **HOW Questions**
   - How will it work?
   - How will we build it?
   - How will we market it?
   - How will we measure success?
   - How much will it cost?
   - How will we scale?
   - How can it fail?
   - How will competitors respond?

10. **Prioritize Questions**
    - Review all questions
    - Identify most critical unknowns
    - Group related questions
    - Create research/investigation plan

11. **Answer Key Questions**
    - Can transition to answering phase
    - Or use questions to guide further exploration
    - Some questions reveal you're not ready to proceed

## Conversation Guide for AI/Application

### Initial Engagement
```
AI: "Let's use Starbursting to thoroughly explore this idea by asking questions. Instead of jumping to solutions, we'll systematically identify everything we need to understand using Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How.

What's the idea, project, or problem we're exploring?"

[Wait for user response]
```

### Setup
```
AI: "Perfect. Let's place [idea] at the center of our star.

We'll work through each point of the star:
- WHO: People, stakeholders, audiences
- WHAT: Features, requirements, alternatives
- WHERE: Location, placement, context
- WHEN: Timing, deadlines, sequence
- WHY: Purpose, motivation, rationale
- HOW: Methods, processes, mechanisms

For each, we'll generate as many questions as possible. The goal is questions, not answers yet.

Ready? Let's start with WHO questions."
```

### WHO Questions
```
AI: "**WHO Questions** - Let's think about all the people involved:

### Review and Prioritization
```
AI: "Fantastic! We've generated a comprehensive question set:

**WHO**: [count] questions
**WHAT**: [count] questions
**WHERE**: [count] questions
**WHEN**: [count] questions
**WHY**: [count] questions
**HOW**: [count] questions

**Total**: [sum] questions

Now let's prioritize. Which questions are:
1. **Critical unknowns** (must answer before proceeding)
2. **Important but not blocking** (good to know)
3. **Nice to have** (can explore later)

What are your top 5-10 most critical questions?

[Help prioritize]"
```

### Action Planning
```
AI: "Based on your critical questions:

**Must Answer Before Proceeding:**
1. [Critical question 1]
2. [Critical question 2]
3. [Critical question 3]
[etc.]

**Action Plan:**
- Who will investigate each question?
- What research/analysis is needed?
- When do we need answers?
- How will we get the information?

Some of these questions might reveal you need more discovery before moving forward. Is that the case?

[Discuss next steps]"
```

## Example Use Cases

### New Product Idea
**Product**: "AI-powered meal planning app"

**WHO**: Who are target users? Who are competitors? Who will develop this? Who are partners (nutritionists, food brands)?

**WHAT**: What features are essential? What differentiates us? What's the revenue model? What dietary restrictions are supported?

**WHERE**: Where will it launch? Where are users (home, grocery, restaurants)? Where is the data stored?

**WHEN**: When will beta launch? When is market timing right? When should features roll out?

**WHY**: Why do people struggle with meal planning? Why us vs. competitors? Why would they pay?

**HOW**: How does AI recommendation work? How do we source recipes? How do we measure success? How much does it cost to build?

### Business Strategy Question
**Topic**: "Should we expand to European market?"

**WHO**: Who are customers there? Who are local competitors? Who will manage European operations?

**WHAT**: What products fit that market? What regulations apply? What is investment required?

**WHERE**: Where specifically (which countries)? Where do we have advantages? Where are risks?

**WHEN**: When is right timing? When can we break even? When do competitors plan expansion?

**WHY**: Why Europe vs. other markets? Why now? Why would European customers choose us?

**HOW**: How will we enter (partnership, acquisition, organic)? How different is go-to-market? How will we support customers?

### Process Improvement
**Topic**: "Implement remote work policy"

**WHO**: Who wants remote work? Who needs to be in office? Who manages remote teams?

**WHAT**: What does "remote" mean (full/hybrid)? What tools are needed? What policies?

**WHERE**: Where can people work from? Where are geographic restrictions? Where do teams collaborate?

**WHEN**: When do we implement? When are check-ins? When do people come to office?

**WHY**: Why implement this? Why now? Why might it fail? Why do employees want it?

**HOW**: How do we maintain culture? How do we measure productivity? How do we onboard remotely? How do we handle equipment?

## Tips for Success
- **Questions only**: Resist urge to answer during generation phase
- **Quantity over quality**: Generate many questions, refine later
- **Build on questions**: Let one question inspire related ones
- **No judgment**: All questions are valid
- **Visual star diagram**: Draw it out, makes it more engaging
- **Time-box per category**: 5-10 minutes per question type
- **Document everything**: All questions matter, even "obvious" ones

## Common Pitfalls
- **Jumping to answers**: Answering instead of questioning
- **Superficial questions**: Not going deep enough
- **Skipping categories**: Neglecting certain question types
- **Analysis paralysis**: Getting overwhelmed by questions
- **Not prioritizing**: Treating all questions as equally important
- **No follow-through**: Generating questions but not investigating them

## Variations

### Two-Round Starbursting
- Round 1: Generate all questions
- Round 2: For each question, ask "Why is this question important?" (meta-questions)

### Starbursting + Answering
- Generate questions using Starbursting
- Use other methods to answer (research, Six Thinking Hats, etc.)

### Repeated Starbursting
- Use on main idea
- Then use on key sub-components
- Creates hierarchical question tree

## Combining with Other Methods

### Starbursting + 5 Whys
- Starbursting generates the questions
- 5 Whys drills into the WHY questions specifically

### Starbursting + SCAMPER
- Starbursting identifies what to explore
- SCAMPER generates creative alternatives

### Starbursting + Mind Mapping
- Use Starbursting questions as branches in mind map
- Organize answers visually

## Key Insight
> "The art and science of asking questions is the source of all knowledge." — Thomas Berger

Starbursting recognizes that before solving a problem or implementing an idea, we must first understand it completely. Questions are the tool of understanding.

## When to Choose Starbursting

**Choose Starbursting When:**
- Exploring new territory (new product, market, strategy)
- High uncertainty or many unknowns
- Need systematic exploration
- Want to avoid "we didn't think of that"
- Team needs alignment on what they don't know

**Choose Other Methods When:**
- Problem is well-understood
- Need to generate solution ideas, not questions
- Need to decide quickly with available information
- Team is already drowning in questions

## Practice Exercise
Apply Starbursting to a personal decision:
- Decision: "Should I buy a house?"
- Generate 10 questions for each of Who, What, Where, When, Why, How
- Notice how questions reveal your assumptions
- Identify which questions you can't answer yet
- Realize if you're ready to decide or need more information
