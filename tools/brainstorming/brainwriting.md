# Brainwriting

## Overview
Brainwriting is a silent brainstorming technique where participants write down ideas on paper and pass them to others, who build on those ideas. It prevents dominance by vocal participants and allows introverts to contribute equally.

## When to Use

### Ideal Situations
- **Diverse teams**: When mixing introverts and extroverts
- **Avoiding groupthink**: When vocal members tend to dominate
- **Remote collaboration**: Easy to adapt for virtual teams
- **Sensitive topics**: When people might hesitate to speak up
- **Time-efficient ideation**: More ideas generated faster than verbal brainstorming
- **Multilingual teams**: Less language barrier than speaking
- **Anonymous contribution needed**: When psychological safety is a concern

### Not Recommended For
- When immediate discussion and debate is needed
- Very time-sensitive decisions (takes 30-45 minutes)
- When team is too small (works best with 5-8 people)
- When writing is difficult (accessibility issues)

## How to Use (6-3-5 Method)

### The 6-3-5 Technique
**6 people, 3 ideas each, 5 minutes per round = 108 ideas in 30 minutes**

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Prepare Materials**
   - Give each participant a sheet divided into 3 columns
   - At top: the problem statement or question
   - Example template:
     ```
     Problem: How can we improve customer onboarding?

     Idea 1: ______ | Idea 2: ______ | Idea 3: ______
     ```

2. **Round 1: Generate Initial Ideas (5 minutes)**
   - Each person silently writes 3 ideas (one per column)
   - Keep it brief—keywords or short phrases
   - No discussion, no talking
   - Time: 5 minutes

3. **Pass Sheets**
   - Pass your sheet to the person on your right
   - You receive sheet from person on your left
   - Now you have someone else's ideas in front of you

4. **Round 2: Build on Ideas (5 minutes)**
   - Read the 3 ideas on the sheet you received
   - Add 3 new ideas that build on, extend, or are inspired by them
   - Write below the original 3 ideas
   - Can modify, combine, or create variations
   - Time: 5 minutes

5. **Continue Passing (Rounds 3-6)**
   - Repeat pass and write process
   - Total: 6 rounds (for 6 people)
   - Each sheet ends up with 18 ideas
   - Keep energy up—this is fast-paced

6. **Collect and Review**
   - Gather all sheets
   - Each sheet has 18 ideas
   - Total: 108 ideas (6 sheets × 18 ideas)
   - Can be done immediately or later

7. **Cluster and Evaluate**
   - Group similar ideas
   - Identify themes
   - Vote on best ideas (dot voting works well)
   - Discuss top candidates

## Conversation Guide for AI/Application

### Initial Setup (For Facilitator)
```
AI: "Let's set up a brainwriting session. This silent brainstorming technique generates many ideas quickly and ensures everyone contributes equally.

What problem or question are we brainstorming about?

[Wait for response]

How many participants? (6-3-5 method works best with 6, but can adapt for 4-8)

[Confirm participant count]"
```

### Prepare and Brief Team
```
AI: "Here's how to brief your team:

'We're doing brainwriting—silent brainstorming. Here's how it works:

1. Everyone gets a sheet with space for 3 ideas
2. Spend 5 minutes writing 3 ideas (one per column)
3. Pass your sheet to the right
4. Read the ideas you receive, then add 3 more ideas that build on them
5. We'll repeat 6 times
6. Stay silent—no talking during rounds

Our question is: [problem statement]

Ready? Let's begin Round 1—write 3 ideas. You have 5 minutes starting...now.'

[Set timer for 5 minutes]"
```

### During Rounds (Facilitator)
```
AI: "**Round 1** (0-5 min): Write your initial 3 ideas
[Wait 5 minutes]

Time! Pass your sheet to the right.

**Round 2** (5-10 min): Read the ideas, add 3 more inspired by what you see
[Wait 5 minutes]

Time! Pass to the right.

**Round 3** (10-15 min): [repeat]

[Continue for rounds 4, 5, 6]

**Round 6 complete!** Collect all sheets."
```

### Review Phase
```
AI: "Now let's review the ideas. We have [108 ideas if 6 people × 6 rounds × 3 ideas].

**Step 1: Quick scan**
Read through all sheets as a team (or individuals read different sheets)

**Step 2: Cluster similar ideas**
Which ideas are related or similar? Group them into themes.

Themes emerging:
- [Theme 1]: [related ideas]
- [Theme 2]: [related ideas]
[etc.]

**Step 3: Identify standout ideas**
Which ideas are most:
- Innovative?
- Feasible?
- Impactful?

Let's use dot voting: Everyone gets 3 votes to place on favorite ideas."
```

### Selection and Next Steps
```
AI: "Top ideas from brainwriting:

1. [Idea A] - [X votes]
2. [Idea B] - [Y votes]
3. [Idea C] - [Z votes]

Next steps:
- Which ideas should we prototype or test?
- Who will develop these further?
- What's the timeline?

[Plan follow-up actions]"
```

## Expected Outcomes

### What This Method Produces
- Large volume of ideas (100+ typical)
- Equal contribution from all participants
- Ideas that build on each other iteratively
- No single voice dominating
- Written record of all ideas
- Diverse perspectives included

### Success Metrics
- Every participant contributed equally (18 ideas each in 6-3-5)
- Quality ideas that built on each other
- Introverts contributed as much as extroverts
- No groupthink or bandwagoning
- Completed in ~30 minutes
- Multiple viable ideas identified

## Variations

### 635 Method (Standard)
- 6 people, 3 ideas, 5 minutes = what we described above

### Adapted for Different Sizes
- **4 people**: 4-3-5 (4 people, 3 ideas, 5 min) = 48 ideas
- **8 people**: 8-3-5 = 192 ideas (might be overwhelming)
- Adjust rounds based on fatigue (can stop after 4 rounds)

### Gallery Method
- Everyone writes ideas on individual sticky notes
- Post on wall
- Walk around adding ideas inspired by what you see
- More flexible than structured passing

### Virtual Brainwriting
- Use collaborative docs (Google Docs, Miro, Mural)
- Same rules: write, pass (share link), build on ideas
- Works well for remote teams

### Brain-netting
- Asynchronous brainwriting via shared document
- Participants add ideas over days, not minutes
- Good for distributed teams in different time zones

## Tips for Success
- **Enforce silence**: No talking during rounds (critical rule)
- **Keep time strictly**: 5 minutes per round, no exceptions
- **Brief clearly**: Make sure everyone understands before starting
- **Anonymize if needed**: Don't put names on sheets
- **Build on ideas**: Encourage variations and combinations
- **Fast pace**: Energy drops if you go too slow
- **Warm up**: Consider a practice round on a fun topic first

## Common Pitfalls
- **Talking during rounds**: Defeats the purpose
- **Too much detail**: Writing paragraphs instead of short ideas
- **Not building on previous**: Treating each round as independent
- **Running over time**: Letting rounds go longer kills energy
- **Judging while writing**: Filtering ideas too early
- **Illegible handwriting**: Type if handwriting is an issue
- **Not enough ideas**: Participants not pushing to fill 3 columns

## Advantages Over Traditional Brainstorming

### Traditional Brainstorming Issues
- Loud voices dominate
- Social loafing (some don't contribute)
- Evaluation apprehension (fear of judgment)
- Production blocking (waiting for turn to speak)
- Anchoring (first ideas influence others too much)

### Brainwriting Solutions
- ✓ Everyone contributes equally
- ✓ Parallel generation (no waiting)
- ✓ Anonymity reduces fear
- ✓ Building on ideas without interruption
- ✓ Written record of everything

## Research Findings
Studies show brainwriting typically generates:
- **2-3x more ideas** than traditional brainstorming
- **Higher quality** ideas due to iterative building
- **More diverse** ideas (less groupthink)
- **Greater satisfaction** from introverted participants

## Combining with Other Methods

### Brainwriting + SCAMPER
- Use SCAMPER prompts as columns instead of just "3 ideas"
- Column 1: Substitute ideas
- Column 2: Combine ideas
- Column 3: Adapt ideas

### Brainwriting + Six Thinking Hats
- Do brainwriting rounds wearing specific hats
- Round 1-2: Green Hat (creative)
- Round 3-4: Yellow Hat (benefits)
- Round 5-6: Black Hat (risks)

### Brainwriting + Affinity Diagram
- Use brainwriting to generate
- Use affinity diagram to organize and synthesize

## Technology and Tools

### Physical Tools
- Paper sheets with 3-column template
- Timer (visible to all)
- Sticky notes (for gallery method)
- Markers

### Digital Tools
- **Google Docs/Sheets**: Shared document, participants take turns editing
- **Miro/Mural**: Virtual whiteboard with sticky notes
- **Stormboard**: Purpose-built for brainwriting
- **Microsoft OneNote**: Shared notebook pages

## Key Insight
> "Brainwriting democratizes ideation. In a world where the loudest voice often wins, brainwriting gives everyone equal space."

By making brainstorming silent and structured, we remove social dynamics that bias idea generation. The result is more ideas from more people.

## When to Choose Brainwriting

**Choose Brainwriting When:**
- Team has dominant personalities
- Introverts are undercontributing
- Need high volume of ideas quickly
- Want to reduce groupthink
- Remote/distributed team

**Choose Traditional Brainstorming When:**
- Need immediate discussion and debate
- Energy and speaking out loud helps creativity
- Building on ideas verbally works better for your team
- Very small team (2-3 people)

## Practice Exercise
Try a mini brainwriting solo:
- Write 3 ideas on a topic
- Wait 5 minutes
- Come back and add 3 more building on the first 3
- Repeat 3 times
- Notice how ideas evolve and compound
