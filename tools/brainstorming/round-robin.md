# Round Robin Brainstorming

## Overview
Round Robin is a structured brainstorming technique where participants take turns contributing one idea at a time in a predetermined order. It ensures equal participation and prevents dominant voices from monopolizing the discussion.

## When to Use

### Ideal Situations
- **Unequal participation**: When some team members dominate discussions
- **Ensuring inclusivity**: When you need input from everyone
- **Structured meetings**: When you want organized, efficient ideation
- **Democratic decision-making**: When all voices matter equally
- **Teaching environments**: Helps students/participants engage
- **Team building**: Creates equal opportunity to contribute
- **Facilitator-led sessions**: Easy to manage and control

### Not Recommended For
- Very large groups (>12 people becomes slow)
- When speed is critical (slower than open brainstorming)
- Highly experienced teams where open flow works better
- When expertise levels vary dramatically (junior members may struggle)

## How to Use

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Set Up the Circle**
   - Arrange participants in a circle (physical or virtual)
   - Determine order (clockwise, alphabetical, random)
   - Clarify the problem or topic
   - Example: "Sitting in circle discussing: Ways to improve team communication"

2. **Explain the Rules**
   - Each person shares ONE idea when it's their turn
   - No interruptions or comments during idea sharing
   - Can pass if no idea, but get another chance next round
   - Keep ideas brief (30 seconds max)
   - No judgment or discussion until collection is complete

3. **Round 1: First Rotation**
   - Person 1 shares an idea
   - Person 2 shares next (different idea)
   - Continue around the circle
   - Facilitator or note-taker records ALL ideas
   - Example rotation:
     - Alice: "Daily stand-ups"
     - Bob: "Shared Slack channel"
     - Carol: "Weekly team lunch"

4. **Round 2+: Continue Rotations**
   - Go around again with new ideas
   - If someone has no new idea, they say "Pass"
   - Can re-enter in next round if idea comes to them
   - Continue until everyone passes consecutively
   - Typical: 3-6 rounds

5. **Handle Passes Gracefully**
   - Passing is okay—no pressure
   - Can contribute again in next round
   - Session ends when everyone passes on a full round

6. **Capture All Ideas Visibly**
   - Write on whiteboard, flip chart, or shared document
   - Number ideas as you go
   - Ensure everyone can see the growing list

7. **Review and Discuss**
   - After collection, review all ideas
   - Now is the time for discussion, questions, building
   - Cluster similar ideas
   - Vote or prioritize

8. **Variations During Rounds**
   - **Building round**: Ideas must build on previous ones
   - **Challenge round**: Respectfully question assumptions
   - **Wild card round**: Most creative/unusual ideas

## Conversation Guide for AI/Application

### Initial Setup (For Facilitator)
```
AI: "Let's organize a Round Robin brainstorming session. This structured approach ensures everyone contributes equally.

What's the problem or topic we're brainstorming about?

[Wait for response]

How many participants? [Confirm number]

I'll guide you through facilitating this session."
```

### Facilitator Briefing
```
AI: "Here's how to brief your team:

'We're doing Round Robin brainstorming. Here are the rules:

1. We'll go around the circle in order
2. Each person shares ONE idea when it's your turn (30 seconds max)
3. No interruptions or comments while someone is sharing
4. If you don't have an idea, say 'Pass'—you can contribute next round
5. We'll keep going until everyone passes a full round
6. I'll record all ideas where everyone can see

Our topic is: [state problem/question]

Let's start with [Person 1]. What's your idea?'

Ready to facilitate?"
```

### During Rounds
```
AI: "**Round 1 - Starting:**

[Person 1], your turn: [idea shared]
✓ Recorded as #1

[Person 2], your turn: [idea shared]
✓ Recorded as #2

[Person 3], your turn: [idea shared]
✓ Recorded as #3

[Continue around circle]

**Round 1 complete - [X] ideas collected.**

**Round 2 - Starting:**
Back to [Person 1]. Do you have another idea?

[Continue process]

[If someone passes]: 'No problem, [Name]. We'll come back to you next round.'

[Continue until full round of passes]

**All done! We've collected [total count] ideas. Great work everyone.**"
```

### Post-Collection Discussion
```
AI: "Now that we've collected ideas, let's review them:

[Read back all ideas]

Open for discussion now:
- Any questions about specific ideas?
- Ways to combine similar ideas?
- Ideas that spark new thoughts?
- Which ideas are most promising?

Let's cluster similar ideas:

**Cluster 1 - [Theme]:**
- Idea #3
- Idea #7
- Idea #12

[Continue clustering]

Now let's prioritize. Each person gets 3 votes—which ideas excite you most?

[Conduct voting]"
```

### Wrap Up
```
AI: "**Round Robin Results:**

**Total ideas generated**: [count]

**Top ideas (by votes)**:
1. [Idea A] - [X votes]
2. [Idea B] - [Y votes]
3. [Idea C] - [Z votes]

**Next steps**:
- Who will develop these top ideas further?
- When do we reconvene?
- Any immediate actions?

[Plan follow-up]

Thanks everyone for contributing equally!"
```

## Expected Outcomes

- No one monopolized discussion
- Participants felt heard

## Example Use Cases

### Team Brainstorming
**Topic**: "Ways to improve customer onboarding"
- Round 1: Everyone shares one idea (8 ideas from 8 people)
- Round 2: Second ideas (6 people have more ideas, 2 pass)
- Round 3: Third ideas (4 people contribute, 4 pass)
- Round 4: (2 contributions, 6 passes)
- Round 5: All pass—session complete
- **Total**: 20 ideas generated

## Tips for Success

### Facilitation
- **Enforce turn-taking**: Don't let anyone jump ahead
- **Keep it moving**: 30 seconds per idea maximum
- **Positive energy**: Thank everyone for contributions
- **No judgment phase**: Save discussion for after collection
- **Visible capture**: Everyone sees their idea recorded

### Participation
- **Think ahead**: Use others' time to think of your idea
- **Brief ideas**: Details can come later in discussion
- **Okay to pass**: No pressure if stuck
- **Build momentum**: Often gets easier after first round

### Managing Challenges
- **Dominant person tries to interrupt**: "We'll hear from everyone in turn"
- **Someone monopolizes their turn**: "Let's keep it to 30 seconds so everyone gets a chance"
- **Quiet person always passes**: "Take your time, we'll come back to you"
- **Ideas repeat**: "That's similar to #5—do you want to add to it or share something different?"

## Common Pitfalls
- **Too rigid**: Sometimes flexibility helps (allow brief builds)
- **Too slow**: Taking too long per person kills energy
- **Pressure to perform**: Making passing feel bad
- **No variety**: All rounds feel the same
- **Lost ideas**: Not capturing clearly or visibly
- **No follow-up**: Generating ideas but not acting on them

## Variations

### Round Robin with Variations by Round
- **Round 1**: Core ideas
- **Round 2**: Build on others' ideas
- **Round 3**: Challenge or question (constructively)
- **Round 4**: Wild card

### Skip Round Robin
- If you pass, you're skipped until you signal you have an idea
- Keeps energy up
- Less waiting

### Popcorn Round Robin (Hybrid)
- Structured order initially
- Later rounds become more free-form
- Good transition from structured to open

### Silent Round Robin (Written)
- Write idea on sticky note during your turn
- Post it silently
- Next person's turn
- Combines Round Robin with Brainwriting benefits

### Reverse Round Robin
- Go backwards after first round
- Changes perspective slightly

## Combining with Other Methods

### Round Robin + SCAMPER
- Each round focuses on one SCAMPER prompt
- Round 1: Substitute ideas
- Round 2: Combine ideas
- etc.

### Round Robin + Six Thinking Hats
- Each round wears a different hat
- Round 1: Green Hat (creative)
- Round 2: Yellow Hat (benefits)
- Round 3: Black Hat (concerns)

### Round Robin + Mind Mapping
- Use Round Robin to generate ideas
- Build mind map during discussion phase
- Structure emerges after democratic collection

## Advantages Over Open Brainstorming

### Equal Participation
- ✓ Everyone gets equal turns
- ✓ Introverts have protected space
- ✓ Junior members contribute alongside seniors

### Prevents Problems
- ✓ No dominant voices
- ✓ No groupthink as easily
- ✓ Less social loafing
- ✓ Can't hide in crowd

### Structure Benefits
- ✓ Efficient use of time
- ✓ Easy to facilitate
- ✓ Clear when session is done

## Disadvantages vs. Open Brainstorming

### Less Spontaneous
- ✗ Loses energy of rapid-fire ideas
- ✗ Can't build immediately on great ideas
- ✗ Waiting for turn might lose thought

### Can Feel Forced
- ✗ Pressure to contribute even if no idea
- ✗ Artificial structure
- ✗ Slower overall

## Key Insight
> "Democracy in ideation: Everyone gets a voice, everyone gets a turn."

Round Robin recognizes that the best idea might come from anyone, and dominant personalities often prevent quieter members from contributing. By structuring turn-taking, we tap into the full team's potential.

## When to Choose Round Robin

**Choose Round Robin When:**
- Team has participation imbalance
- You want structured, democratic input
- Facilitating mixed-experience team
- Teaching environment
- Building inclusive culture

**Choose Open Brainstorming When:**
- Team already contributes equally
- Speed and energy more important than structure
- Very large group
- Highly experienced, collaborative team

## Virtual/Remote Adaptation

### Video Calls
- Use gallery view to see everyone
- Clear order (alphabetical by display name)
- Chat for "pass" or "+1 to that idea"
- Use shared doc/whiteboard for capturing

### Async Round Robin
- Create shared document
- Each person adds idea at scheduled time
- Over hours or days instead of minutes
- Good for distributed teams

### Tools
- Miro/Mural: Visual sticky notes
- Google Docs: Shared document
- Slack: Threaded discussion
- Zoom: Gallery view + whiteboard

## Practice Exercise
Try a solo Round Robin for personal goal-setting:
- Set timer for 3 minutes
- Every 30 seconds is a "turn"
- Write one goal per turn
- Even alone, the structure helps generate ideas systematically
- Notice how forced rhythm prevents overthinking

## Cultural Considerations
- Some cultures may find this very American/Western in structure
- Adapt for contexts where hierarchy or deference matters
- Can start with senior people to signal their participation
- Or reverse (juniors first) to prevent anchoring
