## Brainstorming Best Practices

### Before the Session

**Prepare:**
- Clear problem statement or question
- Right participants invited
- Materials ready (sticky notes, markers, digital tools)
- Time blocked (no interruptions)

**Set Ground Rules:**
- No criticism during generation
- Quantity over quality initially
- Build on others' ideas
- Stay focused on topic

### During the Session

**Facilitate Well:**
- Enforce chosen method
- Keep energy high
- Track time
- Capture ALL ideas

**Watch For:**
- Dominant voices (use Brainwriting/Round Robin)
- Early judging (defer evaluation)
- Going off-topic (redirect)
- Groupthink (use diverse methods)

### After the Session

**Process Ideas:**
1. Organize (Affinity Diagram, Mind Mapping)
2. Evaluate (Six Thinking Hats, voting)
3. Prioritize (Pareto, effort/impact matrix)
4. Action plan (assign owners, deadlines)

## Conversation Flow for AI/Applications

```
1. Understand Goal

   Q: "What's the desired output?"

2. Assess Team
   Q: "How many people?"
   Q: "Any team dynamics to consider?"
   Q: "Remote or in-person?"

3. Check Constraints
   Q: "How much time?"

6. Guide Through Process
   [Use conversation guide from specific method file]

7. Help Organize Output
   "Now let's organize these ideas using..."
   [Suggest synthesis method]
```
