# Six Thinking Hats

## Overview
Six Thinking Hats, developed by Edward de Bono, is a parallel thinking method that uses six metaphorical "hats" to explore different perspectives on a problem. Each hat represents a distinct mode of thinking, allowing systematic exploration without conflict.

## When to Use

### Ideal Situations
- **Team decision-making**: When diverse perspectives are needed
- **Complex problems**: When issues have multiple facets to consider
- **Conflict resolution**: When people are locked in opposing viewpoints
- **Risk assessment**: When you need balanced analysis of opportunities and threats
- **Product/strategy reviews**: When evaluating proposals comprehensively
- **Innovation workshops**: When generating and evaluating new ideas
- **Meeting facilitation**: When you want structured, productive discussions

### Not Recommended For
- Emergency decisions requiring immediate action
- Simple problems with obvious solutions
- When team is unfamiliar with the method (requires brief training)
- One-person decision-making (though can be adapted)

## The Six Hats

### 🤍 White Hat: Facts and Information
- **Focus**: Objective data, facts, figures
- **Ask**: What do we know? What don't we know? What information do we need?
- **Neutral, objective, factual**
- Example: "Sales declined 15% last quarter. Customer acquisition cost increased by $25."

### 🔴 Red Hat: Emotions and Intuition
- **Focus**: Feelings, hunches, gut reactions
- **Ask**: How do I feel about this? What's my intuition saying?
- **No justification needed**—pure emotional response
- Example: "I'm excited but also anxious about this change. Something feels off about the timeline."

### ⚫ Black Hat: Caution and Critical Thinking
- **Focus**: Risks, problems, weaknesses
- **Ask**: What could go wrong? What are the flaws? Why might this fail?
- **Devil's advocate, but constructive**
- Example: "The budget seems unrealistic. We've underestimated integration complexity before."

### 💛 Yellow Hat: Optimism and Benefits
- **Focus**: Opportunities, advantages, positive outcomes
- **Ask**: What are the benefits? Why would this work? What's the upside?
- **Constructive positive thinking**
- Example: "This could differentiate us from competitors and open new market segments."

### 💚 Green Hat: Creativity and Alternatives
- **Focus**: New ideas, possibilities, lateral thinking
- **Ask**: What are alternative approaches? How else could we solve this?
- **Free thinking, no judgment**
- Example: "What if we partnered with them instead of competing? Or used AI to automate this entirely?"

### 🔵 Blue Hat: Process and Control
- **Focus**: Managing the thinking process, big picture
- **Ask**: What hat should we wear now? What have we learned? What's next?
- **Meta-level orchestration**
- Example: "Let's spend 5 minutes in Green Hat mode, then switch to Black Hat to reality-check ideas."

## How to Use

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Define the Problem/Decision**
   - Clearly state what you're thinking about
   - Example: "Should we launch Product X in Q3?"

2. **Establish Blue Hat Context**
   - Facilitator wears Blue Hat
   - Explain the process
   - Set agenda: which hats, in what order, for how long

3. **Use Hats Sequentially (Everyone Wears Same Hat)**
   - Whole team wears one hat at a time
   - Parallel thinking—no debate, just contributions from that perspective
   - Typical sequence: Blue → White → Green → Yellow → Black → Red → Blue

4. **White Hat: Gather Facts**
   - "What do we know about market conditions? Customer needs? Technical feasibility?"
   - List information, identify gaps

5. **Green Hat: Generate Ideas**
   - "What are all possible approaches? Let's brainstorm without judgment."
   - Encourage wild ideas, quantity over quality

6. **Yellow Hat: Find Benefits**
   - "What's exciting about these ideas? What value do they create?"
   - Build on positive possibilities

7. **Black Hat: Identify Risks**
   - "What could go wrong? What are the weaknesses?"
   - Critical analysis, but constructive

8. **Red Hat: Express Feelings**
   - "How does this feel now? Any gut reactions?"
   - Brief emotional check-in, no justification needed

9. **Blue Hat: Synthesize and Decide**
   - "What did we learn? What's our conclusion? What's next?"
   - Facilitator summarizes and guides toward action

10. **Switch Hats as Needed**
    - Can revisit hats if needed
    - Example: After Black Hat reveals issues, return to Green Hat for solutions

## Conversation Guide for AI/Application

### Initial Engagement
```
AI: "Let's use the Six Thinking Hats method to explore this from multiple perspectives systematically.

I'll guide you through six different thinking modes, each represented by a colored hat. This prevents arguments and ensures we consider all angles.

What problem or decision are we thinking about?"

[Wait for user response]
```

### Blue Hat (Setup)
```
AI: "Great. I'm putting on the BLUE HAT now—this is the process control hat.

Here's our agenda:
1. White Hat: Gather facts and information
2. Green Hat: Generate creative ideas
3. Yellow Hat: Explore benefits and opportunities
4. Black Hat: Identify risks and problems
5. Red Hat: Express feelings and intuition
6. Blue Hat: Synthesize and decide

We'll spend about 5 minutes on each hat. Everyone (or you) wears the same hat at the same time—parallel thinking, not debate.

Ready to start?"
```

### White Hat Session
```
AI: "Everyone put on the WHITE HAT 🤍—we're thinking factually and objectively.

What do we know for certain about this problem/decision?
- Facts about the situation
- Data and numbers
- What information do we have?
- What information is missing?

Just facts, no opinions or feelings yet.

[Collect factual information]

Information gaps we've identified: [list]"
```

### Green Hat Session
```
AI: "Now put on the GREEN HAT 💚—time for creative thinking!

No judgment, no 'that won't work'—just ideas:
- What are all possible solutions?
- What if we approached this completely differently?
- Wild ideas welcome!
- Build on each other's suggestions

Brainstorm away:

[Collect creative ideas without filtering]

Great! We've generated [X] ideas. Let's keep them all for now."
```

### Yellow Hat Session
```
AI: "Put on the YELLOW HAT 💛—let's be optimistic and look for benefits!

For the ideas we generated:
- What's exciting about these?
- What value do they create?
- What opportunities do they open?
- What's the best-case scenario?

Think positively—what's the upside?

[Collect positive perspectives, benefits, opportunities]

Good! We've identified strong potential value."
```

### Black Hat Session
```
AI: "Now the BLACK HAT ⚫—time for critical thinking and caution.

Let's identify risks and potential problems:
- What could go wrong?
- What are the weaknesses in these ideas?
- What are we overlooking?
- What constraints or obstacles exist?
- Why might this fail?

Be critical, but constructive:

[Collect risks, weaknesses, concerns]

Important considerations we can't ignore: [summarize]"
```

### Red Hat Session
```
AI: "Time for the RED HAT 🔴—gut feelings and emotions.

No justification needed—just express how you feel:
- What's your intuition about this?
- How does this make you feel?
- Any hunches or gut reactions?
- Excitement? Anxiety? Confidence?

Quick emotional check-in:

[Collect emotional responses]

Emotional pulse: [summarize feelings]"
```

### Blue Hat Synthesis
```
AI: "Back to the BLUE HAT 🔵—let's synthesize what we've learned.

**Facts (White)**: [summary]
**Ideas generated (Green)**: [summary]
**Benefits identified (Yellow)**: [summary]
**Risks identified (Black)**: [summary]
**Gut feelings (Red)**: [summary]

**Synthesis**: Based on all perspectives:
- Strongest ideas: [which ideas have most support across hats]
- Key risks to mitigate: [from Black Hat]
- Decision/recommendation: [synthesized conclusion]
- Next steps: [actions]

Does this capture our thinking? Any hat we should revisit?"
```

## Expected Outcomes

### What This Method Produces
- Comprehensive exploration of all angles
- Reduced conflict (everyone wears same hat simultaneously)
- Balanced perspective (positive, negative, creative, factual)
- Clearer decision-making process
- Team alignment on reasoning
- Documented thinking from multiple perspectives

### Success Metrics
- All perspectives have been heard
- Reduced defensive arguing
- Risks and benefits both identified
- Creative alternatives generated

## Example Use Cases

### Product Launch Decision
- **White**: Market size data, competitive analysis, development costs
- **Green**: Alternative launch strategies, creative marketing approaches
- **Yellow**: Market opportunity, revenue potential, brand building
- **Black**: Timing risks, resource constraints, competitive responses
- **Red**: Team excitement but concern about readiness
- **Blue**: Decision to launch with phased rollout to mitigate timing concerns

### Hiring Decision
- **White**: Candidate's experience, qualifications, references
- **Green**: How role could evolve, alternative team structures
- **Yellow**: What candidate brings, cultural addition, growth potential
- **Black**: Skill gaps, culture fit concerns, onboarding time
- **Red**: Good feeling about passion, slight concern about communication style
- **Blue**: Hire with 90-day focused onboarding plan

### Process Improvement
- **White**: Current process takes 5 days, costs $10K, 15% error rate
- **Green**: Automation options, workflow redesigns, outsourcing possibilities
- **Yellow**: Could reduce time 80%, free up team for higher-value work
- **Black**: Implementation cost $50K, learning curve, integration challenges
- **Red**: Team is excited but worried about job security
- **Blue**: Proceed with pilot, involve team in design, address concerns transparently

## Tips for Success
- **Enforce the hat**: Everyone wears the same hat at the same time—no mixing
- **Blue Hat facilitates**: Someone needs to manage process and time
- **No debate during hats**: Save discussion for Blue Hat synthesis
- **Time-box each hat**: 5-10 minutes usually sufficient
- **Visual reminders**: Use actual colored paper, slides, or icons
- **Practice makes perfect**: Team gets better with repetition
- **Safe space for Red Hat**: Emotions are valid, no justification needed
- **Black Hat isn't negative**: It's risk management, not pessimism

## Common Pitfalls
- **Mixed hats**: Slipping into other modes (e.g., being critical during Yellow Hat)
- **Skipping hats**: Neglecting Black or Red because they're uncomfortable
- **Too much time**: Dwelling too long on one hat
- **No Blue Hat**: Forgetting to synthesize and decide
- **Fighting the hat**: "I don't feel optimistic" during Yellow Hat—try anyway
- **Solo use confusion**: Method designed for groups; adapting for individuals takes practice

## Hat Sequences for Different Situations

### Quick Decision
Blue → White → Green → Black → Blue (30 minutes)

### Innovation Session
Blue → White → Green → Yellow → Green → Black → Blue (emphasize creativity)

### Risk Assessment
Blue → White → Black → Yellow → Blue (focus on identifying and mitigating risks)

### Team Conflict Resolution
Blue → Red (express feelings) → White (facts) → Green (alternatives) → Yellow/Black → Red → Blue

### Strategic Planning
Blue → White → Green → Yellow → Black → Red → Blue → (revisit Green for solutions to Black concerns) → Blue

## Combining with Other Methods
- **Six Hats + SCAMPER**: Use Green Hat time to run SCAMPER prompts
- **Six Hats + Pyramid Principle**: Structure final recommendation after Blue Hat synthesis
- **Six Hats + MECE**: Ensure White Hat facts and Green Hat ideas are MECE organized

## Key Insight
> "The main difficulty of thinking is confusion. We try to do too much at once. The six hats allow us to conduct our thinking as a conductor conducts an orchestra." — Edward de Bono

By separating thinking into distinct modes, we eliminate the confusion of trying to be creative, critical, and factual simultaneously. Parallel thinking is more productive than argumentative thinking.
