# Thematic Analysis

## Overview
Thematic Analysis is a systematic method for identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within qualitative data. It provides a detailed, nuanced account of data through iterative coding and theme development.

## When to Use

### Ideal Situations
- **Academic research**: Analyzing interview transcripts, focus groups
- **Deep user research**: Understanding motivations, beliefs, experiences
- **Content analysis**: Analyzing documents, social media, open-ended surveys
- **Literature reviews**: Synthesizing themes across multiple sources
- **Program evaluation**: Understanding stakeholder experiences
- **When rigor is required**: Need defensible, documented analysis process

### Not Recommended For
- Quick, lightweight analysis (use Affinity Diagramming)
- When themes are obvious and surface-level
- Quantitative data
- Very small data sets

## How to Use (Braun & Clarke 6-Phase Method)

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Data**
   - Read and re-read your data (transcripts, notes, documents)
   - Immerse yourself in depth and breadth
   - Note initial ideas, observations
   - Example: Read all 15 interview transcripts fully

2. **Generate Initial Codes**
   - Code interesting features systematically
   - Codes are labels for important moments in data
   - Can code for semantic (explicit) or latent (implicit) meaning
   - Use consistent approach across dataset
   - Example codes: "frustration with process", "values efficiency", "workaround developed"

3. **Search for Themes**
   - Collate codes into potential themes
   - Theme = patterned meaning across the dataset
   - Use visual tools (mind maps, tables)
   - Gather all relevant coded extracts for each theme
   - Example theme: "Resistance to change" (includes codes: frustration, workarounds, skepticism)

4. **Review Themes**
   - Check themes against coded extracts (Level 1)
   - Check themes against entire dataset (Level 2)
   - Refine, split, combine, or discard themes
   - Create thematic map showing relationships
   - Example: Split "Resistance" into "Active resistance" and "Passive adaptation"

5. **Define and Name Themes**
   - Clearly define each theme
   - Write detailed analysis of what each theme means
   - Ensure themes are distinct
   - Create compelling, descriptive names
   - Example: "Technology as villain: How users blame the tool instead of the process"

6. **Produce the Report**
   - Select vivid examples (quotes) for each theme
   - Final analysis relates back to research question
   - Tell a coherent story about the data
   - Balance description and interpretation

## Conversation Guide for AI/Application

### Initial Setup
```
AI: "Let's conduct a Thematic Analysis on your qualitative data. This is a rigorous method for identifying patterns and themes.

What data are we analyzing?
- Interview transcripts?
- Survey responses?
- Documents?
- Observations?

[Wait for response]

How much data? (Number of interviews, pages, responses)

This method takes time but provides deep insights. Ready to begin?"
```

### Phase 1: Familiarization
```
AI: "**Phase 1: Familiarize with Data**

First, you need to deeply know your data.

- Read all transcripts/documents thoroughly
- Read actively—note interesting points
- Immerse yourself in the details

Questions while reading:
- What stands out?
- What patterns do you notice?
- What's surprising?
- What relates to your research question?

Take notes as you read. Once you've read everything, tell me:
- Overall impressions?
- Recurring ideas you noticed?
- Initial thoughts on patterns?

[Collect initial observations]"
```

### Phase 2: Coding
```
AI: "**Phase 2: Generate Codes**

Now we'll systematically code the data. A code is a label that captures something interesting.

**Coding approach:**
- Go through data line by line (or segment by segment)
- Identify anything relevant to your research question
- Create a code (short label) for it
- Apply same code to similar content elsewhere
- New codes emerge as you go

**Example:**
Text: "I find the new system frustrating because it takes twice as long"
Codes:
- "Frustration with new system"
- "Efficiency concerns"
- "Time increase"

Let's start coding. Share a segment of your data:

[Help user code segments]

Keep a codebook: List of codes with definitions

By the end, you'll have 50-100+ codes (typical). We'll group these next."
```

### Phase 3: Search for Themes
```
AI: "**Phase 3: Search for Themes**

Now let's group codes into themes. A theme:
- Captures important pattern in the data
- Is broader than a code
- Multiple codes can contribute to one theme

**Process:**
- Look at your codes
- Which codes cluster together?
- What's the connecting idea?

Example:
Codes: "frustration", "anger at system", "blames technology", "misses old way"
Potential theme: "Negative emotional response to change"

You have [X] codes. Let's group them:

What patterns do you see? Which codes relate?

[Help identify theme candidates]

Typically: 5-10 major themes emerge

Your potential themes:
1. [Theme candidate 1]
2. [Theme candidate 2]
[etc.]"
```

### Phase 4: Review Themes
```
AI: "**Phase 4: Review and Refine Themes**

Let's test your themes:

**Level 1: Check against coded extracts**
For [Theme 1]:
- Re-read all coded extracts grouped under this theme
- Do they form coherent pattern?
- Any that don't fit?

[Review each theme]

**Level 2: Check against entire dataset**
- Re-read your full dataset
- Do themes capture important patterns?
- Did you miss anything?

**Refinements needed?**
- Split themes that are too broad?
- Combine themes that overlap?
- Discard themes that aren't strong?
- Add missing themes?

Your refined themes:
1. [Theme 1 - refined]
2. [Theme 2 - refined]
[etc.]"
```

### Phase 5: Define and Name
```
AI: "**Phase 5: Define and Name Themes**

For each theme, let's:
1. Write a detailed definition
2. Describe what it captures
3. Create a compelling name

**Theme 1:**
- Working name: [current name]
- What does this theme capture?
- What's the 'story' of this theme?
- What quotes exemplify it?
- Better name?

[Work through each theme]

**Final Themes:**

**1. [Final Name]**
Definition: [Clear description]
Key aspects: [What it includes]

**2. [Final Name]**
Definition: [Clear description]
Key aspects: [What it includes]

[etc.]"
```

### Phase 6: Report
```
AI: "**Phase 6: Produce Report**

Let's create your final analysis.

For each theme:
- Narrative description
- Interpretation (what does it mean?)
- Evidence (vivid quotes)
- Connection to research question

**Theme 1: [Name]**
[Your analysis]

Supporting quotes:
- "[Quote 1]" (Participant 3)
- "[Quote 2]" (Participant 7)

**Overall Insights:**
- What do these themes tell us?
- How do they relate to each other?
- What's the answer to your research question?
- What are implications?

[Help synthesize final report]"
```

## Example Use Cases

### UX Research: Understanding App Abandonment
**Data**: 20 interviews with users who stopped using app

**Initial Codes** (50+ codes generated):
- "Too many notifications", "Felt spammed", "Couldn't turn off alerts"
- "Didn't see value", "Nothing new", "Became routine"
- "Privacy concerns", "Data worries", "Didn't trust"

**Themes** (6 themes identified):
1. **Notification Fatigue**: Push overload drove users away
2. **Value Decay**: Initial excitement faded without ongoing value
3. **Privacy Anxiety**: Trust eroded over time
4. **Social Comparison Stress**: App triggered negative emotions
5. **Lack of Personalization**: One-size-fits-all didn't work
6. **Onboarding Failure**: Never established usage habit

### Employee Experience Research
**Data**: Survey responses + 12 interviews about remote work

**Themes**:
1. **Boundaries Blur**: Home/work distinction dissolved
2. **Connection Crisis**: Missing informal social interactions
3. **Productivity Paradox**: Working more but feeling less productive
4. **Autonomy Anxiety**: Freedom felt isolating
5. **Technology Burden**: Tools became overwhelming

## Tips for Success

### Coding
- **Be systematic**: Code entire dataset consistently
- **Stay open**: Let codes emerge, don't force preconceptions
- **Be flexible**: Codes evolve as you learn from data
- **Document**: Keep codebook with definitions

### Theme Development
- **Look for patterns**: Repetition, similarity, clustering
- **Go beyond topics**: Themes interpret meaning, not just categorize
- **Consider relationships**: How do themes connect?
- **Ensure distinctness**: Themes shouldn't overlap too much

### Quality
- **Researcher reflexivity**: Acknowledge your perspective/biases
- **Member checking**: Validate with participants if possible
- **Thick description**: Provide context and detail
- **Audit trail**: Document decisions throughout

## Common Pitfalls
- **Rushing familiarization**: Not knowing data well enough
- **Too many codes**: Can happen; refine and consolidate
- **Themes as summaries**: Should interpret, not just summarize
- **Themes overlap**: Need clearer boundaries
- **Cherry-picking quotes**: Select representative evidence
- **Ignoring disconfirming data**: Address contradictions
- **No reflexivity**: Not acknowledging researcher influence

## Inductive vs. Deductive Approach

### Inductive (Bottom-Up)
- Themes driven by data itself
- No pre-existing framework
- Exploratory
- Example: "What themes emerge from user interviews?"

### Deductive (Top-Down)
- Themes driven by theoretical framework
- Pre-defined codes or themes
- Confirmatory
- Example: "How do interviews reflect Self-Determination Theory?"

## Semantic vs. Latent Themes

### Semantic
- Surface-level meanings
- What participants explicitly said
- Descriptive
- Example: "Users want faster load times"

### Latent
- Underlying meanings
- Interpretive, reading between lines
- Conceptual
- Example: "Users equate speed with respect for their time"

## Digital Tools

### Qualitative Data Analysis Software
- **NVivo**: Industry standard, powerful
- **MAXQDA**: User-friendly alternative
- **Atlas.ti**: Good for grounded theory approach
- **Dedoose**: Web-based, collaborative
- **Coding Analysis Toolkit (CAT)**: Free, basic

### Features
- Code management
