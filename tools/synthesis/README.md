| Wrong metric | Pareto | Use impact-weighted, not just frequency |
| Talking during silent sorting | KJ Method | Enforce silence strictly |
| Vague linking phrases | Concept Mapping | Use specific relationships |
| Overlapping categories | All | Use MECE principle |
| Analysis paralysis | Thematic | Set time limits per phase |
