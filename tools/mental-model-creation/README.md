## Combining Methods

These methods are often most powerful when combined:

### Common Combinations

**1. First Principles + Analogical Thinking**
- First Principles: Understand fundamentals
- Analogical: Find creative applications from other domains
- Result: Innovation grounded in reality

**2. 5 Whys + Systems Thinking**
- 5 Whys: Drill to immediate cause
- Systems Thinking: Understand why that cause exists in system
- Result: Address root cause AND systemic enablers

**3. Second-Order + Inversion**
- Second-Order: "If we do X, what happens?"
- Inversion: "What would cause failure?"
- Result: Comprehensive risk and opportunity analysis

**4. Socratic Questioning + First Principles**
- Socratic: Question assumptions through dialogue
- First Principles: Build up from basics once assumptions cleared
- Result: Deep understanding and novel solutions

## Conversation Flow for AI/Applications

When helping a user select a method:

```
1. Understand the Context
   Q: "What are you working on?"
   Q: "Is this a problem to solve, decision to make, or something to learn?"

2. Assess Complexity
   Q: "Is this straightforward or complex with many moving parts?"
   Q: "Have you tried solving this before?"

3. Check Constraints
   Q: "How much time do you have?"
   Q: "Are you working alone or with a team?"

4. Suggest Method
   Based on answers:
   - Simple problem, limited time → 5 Whys
   - Need innovation, have time → First Principles
   - Strategic decision → Second-Order + Inversion
   - Complex system → Systems Thinking
   - Learning/teaching → Socratic Questioning
   - Unfamiliar domain → Analogical Thinking

5. Offer Combination
   "Would you also like to apply [complementary method] to strengthen the analysis?"
```

## Method Characteristics

### 5 Whys
- **Strength**: Simple, fast, effective for linear causation
- **Limitation**: Can oversimplify, may miss multiple causes
- **When it fails**: Complex systems, circular causation

### First Principles Thinking
- **Strength**: Breakthrough insights, challenges conventions
- **Limitation**: Time-intensive, can be too radical for incremental needs
- **When it fails**: When existing solutions work fine, time pressure

### Second-Order Thinking
- **Strength**: Reveals unintended consequences, strategic depth
- **Limitation**: Can lead to analysis paralysis
- **When it fails**: Too many unknowables, emergency situations

### Inversion
- **Strength**: Reveals blind spots, identifies risks
- **Limitation**: Can be pessimistic without positive planning
- **When it fails**: Over-analysis leads to inaction

### Systems Thinking
- **Strength**: Holistic view, addresses root causes
- **Limitation**: Complex, time-consuming
- **When it fails**: Simple problems, when system boundaries unclear

### Socratic Questioning
- **Strength**: Deep understanding, intellectual humility
- **Limitation**: Requires genuine curiosity, can feel slow
- **When it fails**: Time pressure, defensive participants

### Analogical Thinking
- **Strength**: Creative insights, accelerates learning
- **Limitation**: Can mislead if analogy is poor
- **When it fails**: Forcing superficial similarities

**Remember**: The goal isn't to use the most sophisticated method, but the right method for your situation. Sometimes 5 Whys solves in 15 minutes what doesn't need systems thinking for 3 hours.
