# PechaKucha 20x20

## Overview
PechaKucha (Japanese for "chit chat") is a presentation format where you show 20 slides, each displayed for exactly 20 seconds, resulting in a 6 minute 40 second presentation. It forces conciseness, visual focus, and energetic pacing.

## When to Use

### Ideal Situations
- **Creative presentations**: Design, architecture, art, photography
- **Idea showcases**: Sharing concepts quickly and visually
- **Lightning talks**: Conference or meetup presentations
- **Team updates**: Keeping status reports crisp and engaging
- **Portfolio reviews**: Showing work without excessive detail
- **Inspiration sessions**: Motivating with energy and pace
- **Pitch practice**: Training for concise communication

### Not Recommended For
- Detailed technical explanations requiring pause and discussion
- Data-heavy presentations needing careful analysis
- Training sessions where audience needs time to learn
- Formal business recommendations requiring deliberation
- Audiences unfamiliar with the format (may feel rushed)

## How to Use

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Define Your Core Message**
   - What's the single most important thing to communicate?
   - Example: "Our design approach transforms user experience"

2. **Outline Your Story Arc**
   - With only 20 slides (6:40), structure is critical
   - Recommended structure:
     - Slides 1-3: Setup/Context (1 minute)
     - Slides 4-16: Main content with build (4:20)
     - Slides 17-20: Resolution/Takeaway (1:20)

3. **Select 20 Images**
   - Each slide should be primarily visual
   - Minimal or no text (if text, very few words)
   - Images should convey meaning, not just decorate
   - Quality matters—blurry or stock photos break the flow

4. **Write Your Script**
   - You have 20 seconds per slide
   - Roughly 50-70 words per slide
   - Script must flow naturally as slides advance
   - Practice transitions between slides

5. **Design Slides**
   - Full-screen images
   - Text only if essential (and minimal)
   - Consistent visual style
   - High contrast for readability

6. **Set Auto-Advance**
   - Slides advance automatically every 20 seconds
   - You cannot control timing—must adapt to the pace
   - PowerPoint/Keynote can be set to auto-advance

7. **Practice, Practice, Practice**
   - You must know exactly what to say for each slide
   - Practice with the timer running
   - Adjust script to fit 20-second chunks
   - Get comfortable with the relentless pace

8. **Deliver with Energy**
   - The format is fast—match it with energy
   - Don't fight the timing—ride it
   - If you stumble, keep going
   - Embrace the challenge

## Conversation Guide for AI/Application

### Initial Engagement
```
AI: "Let's create a PechaKucha presentation—20 slides, 20 seconds each, 6 minutes 40 seconds total. This format forces you to be visual, concise, and energetic.

What's your topic and core message?"

[Wait for user response]
```

### Content Planning
```
AI: "With only 20 slides and 6:40, every slide counts. Let's outline your structure:

**SETUP (Slides 1-3, ~1 minute):**
- Grab attention
- Establish context
- Set up your theme

**MAIN CONTENT (Slides 4-16, ~4:20):**
- Core of your message
- Build your narrative
- Show examples/evidence

**RESOLUTION (Slides 17-20, ~1:20):**
- Bring it home
- Key takeaway
- Call to action or memorable close

What are the key beats in your story?"

[Help user outline 20 slide progression]
```

### Slide-by-Slide Planning
```
AI: "Let's plan each slide. For each, I need:
1. The visual (what image/photo?)
2. What you'll say (50-70 words)
3. Purpose of this slide

Let's start:

**Slide 1 (0:00-0:20):**
- Visual: [describe]
- You say: [draft]
- Purpose: Hook the audience

**Slide 2 (0:20-0:40):**
[continue for all 20 slides]

Remember: images do the heavy lifting, your words complement them."
```

### Script Development
```
AI: "Now let's write your full script. You have approximately 60 words per slide (speaking at natural pace).

I'll help you pace this. For Slide [X]:

[Current draft: XX words]

This is [too long/too short/just right]. Let's adjust:

[Help refine to fit 20 seconds]

Key: Your transitions between slides must be smooth even though slides advance automatically."
```

### Visual Selection Guidance
```
AI: "For your 20 images, let's ensure each is purposeful:

Types of visuals that work well:
- Your own photos/work
- Metaphorical images
- Data visualizations (simple ones)
- Process diagrams
- Before/after comparisons
- Faces (showing emotion)

Avoid:
- Bullet points
- Walls of text
- Generic stock photos
- Complex charts

For slide [X], you want to convey [message]. What image would powerfully show this?"

[Help user select meaningful visuals]
```

### Practice Guidance
```
AI: "Time to practice! Here's how:

1. Set up your slides to auto-advance at 20 seconds
2. Run through start to finish—don't stop if you mess up
3. Record yourself (video or audio)
4. Watch/listen back—where did you rush or drag?
5. Adjust script where timing is off
6. Practice 5-10 times minimum

The format is unforgiving—but that's the point. You'll get sharp and tight.

Ready to practice? Let me know how it goes and where you need adjustments."

## Tips for Success

### Content
- **One idea per slide**: Don't pack multiple concepts
- **Visual storytelling**: Let images carry meaning
- **Narrative flow**: Each slide should lead to next
- **Minimal text**: If you need words, make them BIG and FEW
- **Strong opening and closing**: First and last slides are most remembered

### Design
- **Full-bleed images**: Edge to edge
- **High resolution**: Blurry images kill credibility
- **Consistent style**: Filters, fonts, layouts
- **Readable from back of room**: High contrast
- **Avoid templates**: This is about YOUR unique story

### Delivery
- **Know your script cold**: No reading, no improvising
- **Match the pace**: Energy should fit the speed
- **Practice with timer**: Non-negotiable
- **Embrace constraints**: Don't fight the format
- **Breathe**: It's easy to rush and run out of air
- **Gesture naturally**: Don't let speed make you stiff

## Common Pitfalls
- **Too much text**: Slides become word-heavy
- **Generic images**: Stock photos that don't connect to content
- **Unpracticed**: Trying to wing it—you'll crash
- **Fighting the timer**: Getting frustrated by 20-second constraint
- **Too complex**: Trying to explain intricate ideas in 20 seconds
- **No narrative**: Random slides without connecting story
- **Slow start**: Wasting early slides on title/intro fluff

## Variations and Adaptations

### PechaKucha Lite (10x20)
- 10 slides, 20 seconds each = 3:20 total
- Good for very short updates or intros

### Modified PechaKucha (20x30 or 20x15)
- Adjusting seconds per slide for different pacing
- 20x30 = 10 minutes (more comfortable for some content)
- 20x15 = 5 minutes (even faster)

### Manual PechaKucha
- Keep 20-slide limit but advance manually
- Maintains slide constraint without time pressure
- Good for practice or informal settings

## Technology Setup

### PowerPoint
- Transitions → Advance slide → After: 00:20
- Set for all slides
- Rehearse Timings feature to verify

### Keynote
- Document Inspector → Set all slides to auto-advance after 20 seconds
- Use Rehearse Slideshow to practice

### Google Slides
- Publish to web → Auto-advance slides every 20 seconds
- Or use Auto-play extension

## History and Culture
- **Origin**: Created 2003 by architects Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham in Tokyo
- **Purpose**: Keep presentations short at their architecture events
- **Global phenomenon**: PechaKucha Nights in 1000+ cities worldwide
- **Community**: Creative professionals sharing work in this format
- **Philosophy**: "The art of concise storytelling"

## Combining with Other Methods

### PechaKucha + Storytelling Arc
- Slides 1-4: Exposition/Setup
- Slides 5-15: Rising Action/Climax
- Slides 16-20: Resolution

### PechaKucha + Rule of Three
- Three main sections in your 20 slides
- Three examples of your concept
- Three key takeaways in final slides

## When NOT to Use PechaKucha
- Client presentations requiring questions/discussion
- Teaching complex technical material
- Presenting data requiring analysis time
- Formal board meetings or investor pitches
- When audience expects traditional format

## Key Insight
> "Constraints breed creativity."

The PechaKucha format seems limiting, but that's precisely the point. By forcing you to be concise and visual, it makes you think harder about what truly matters. The best PechaKucha presentations feel effortless—but that ease comes from intense preparation.
