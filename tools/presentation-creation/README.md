## Method Characteristics

### Pyramid Principle
- **Structure**: Answer first, support below
- **Best for**: Busy executives, clear recommendations
- **Pairs with**: SCQA (for intro), MECE (for structure)
- **Avoid when**: Building suspense, teaching step-by-step

### SCQA Framework
- **Structure**: Situation → Complication → Question → Answer
- **Best for**: Creating narrative, setting context
- **Pairs with**: Pyramid Principle (SCQA introduces Pyramid)
- **Avoid when**: Extremely time-sensitive, audience knows context

### Rule of Three
- **Structure**: Three main points/examples/sections
- **Best for**: Memorability, speeches
- **Pairs with**: Any method (apply as organizing principle)
- **Avoid when**: Four points are actually needed

### Storytelling Arc
- **Structure**: Exposition → Rising Action → Climax → Resolution
- **Best for**: Engagement, emotional connection
- **Pairs with**: Rule of Three (three acts)
- **Avoid when**: Pure data presentation, time is very limited

### PechaKucha
- **Structure**: 20 slides × 20 seconds = 6:40
- **Best for**: Visual storytelling, creative fields
- **Pairs with**: Storytelling Arc (for narrative structure)
- **Avoid when**: Need flexibility, complex data, discussion

### MECE Principle
- **Structure**: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive categories
- **Best for**: Organizing arguments, ensuring completeness
- **Pairs with**: Pyramid Principle (MECE ensures clean level 2)
- **Avoid when**: Early brainstorming, overlap is natural

## Combining Methods

### Pyramid + SCQA (Most Common in Business)
1. **SCQA**: Set up the story
   - Situation: Current state
   - Complication: Problem emerged
   - Question: What should we do?
   - Answer: Our recommendation

2. **Pyramid**: Explain the answer
   - Top: Recommendation (from SCQA Answer)
   - Level 2: 3-5 supporting arguments (MECE)
   - Level 3: Evidence and data

**Result**: Compelling narrative + structured support

### Storytelling Arc + Rule of Three
1. **Rule of Three**: Plan three-act structure
   - Act 1: Setup
   - Act 2: Conflict and climax
   - Act 3: Resolution

2. **Storytelling Arc**: Fill in each act
   - Detailed emotional journey within three-act frame

**Result**: Structured narrative with memorable beats

### MECE + Pyramid
1. **MECE**: Ensure clean categories
   - Level 2 arguments are mutually exclusive
   - Together they're collectively exhaustive

2. **Pyramid**: Organize hierarchically
   - MECE ensures horizontal logic is sound

**Result**: Airtight, comprehensive structure

## Conversation Flow for AI/Applications

```
1. Understand Purpose
   Q: "What's the goal of your presentation?"
   - Inform, persuade, inspire, recommend?

2. Know Your Audience
   Q: "Who are you presenting to?"
   - Executives, peers, public, technical experts?

3. Assess Constraints
   Q: "How long is your presentation?"
   Q: "When do you present?"

4. Check Content Type
   Q: "What type of content?"
   - Data/analysis, story, recommendation, teaching?

5. Suggest Primary Method
   Based on answers:
   - Business recommendation → Pyramid + SCQA
   - Public speech → Storytelling Arc + Rule of Three
   - Quick update → Rule of Three + SCQA
   - Creative showcase → PechaKucha
   - Complex organization → MECE + Pyramid

6. Offer Structure
   "Would you like help structuring your content using [method]?"
