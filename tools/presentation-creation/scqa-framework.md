# SCQA Framework

## Overview
SCQA (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer) is a storytelling framework used to structure presentations and documents. It sets up context, introduces tension, poses a question, then delivers the answer—creating a narrative arc that engages audiences.

## When to Use

### Ideal Situations
- **Executive presentations**: Getting buy-in from leadership
- **Consulting recommendations**: Standard framework in top consulting firms
- **Proposal writing**: Structuring business cases or project proposals
- **Stakeholder updates**: Providing context for decisions
- **Strategic documents**: Creating compelling business narratives
- **Teaching/training**: When you need to motivate learning

### Not Recommended For
- Urgent emergency briefings (too much setup)
- Audiences who already fully understand the context
- Highly technical documentation (where narrative isn't needed)
- When answer needs to be given immediately (safety, crisis)

## How to Use

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **SITUATION: Set the Stage**
   - Establish a stable, uncontroversial starting point
   - Describe current state that everyone can agree on
   - Should be neutral and factual
   - Example: "Our company has been operating in the North American market for 15 years with steady 5% annual growth"

2. **COMPLICATION: Introduce Tension**
   - Something changes, creates a problem, or presents an opportunity
   - This disrupts the stable situation
   - Creates urgency and interest
   - Example: "However, growth has stalled over the last two quarters while our competitors are expanding internationally at 20% annually"

3. **QUESTION: Pose the Central Question**
   - This emerges naturally from the complication
   - Should be the question your audience is now thinking
   - Might be explicit or implicit
   - Example: "Should we expand internationally, and if so, how?"

4. **ANSWER: Provide Your Solution**
   - This is your recommendation, conclusion, or key message
   - Should directly address the question
   - This becomes the top of your Pyramid Principle structure
   - Example: "We recommend entering the Asian market in Q3, starting with Singapore"

5. **DEVELOP THE ANSWER (Optional Extended)**
   - After stating answer, provide supporting arguments
   - This is where Pyramid Principle structure continues
   - Evidence, data, analysis supporting your answer

## Conversation Guide for AI/Application

### Initial Engagement
```
AI: "Let's structure your presentation using the SCQA framework—this will create a compelling narrative that leads to your recommendation.

We'll work through four parts: Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer.

Let's start with Situation: What's the current state? Describe the stable, uncontroversial starting point."

[Wait for user response]
```

### Situation Development
```
AI: "Good. Let's make sure your Situation is strong:

- Is this something everyone would agree on? ✓/✗
- Is it neutral (not already suggesting a problem)? ✓/✗
- Does it establish necessary context? ✓/✗

Your Situation: [refined version]

This sets a stable baseline. Now let's disrupt it."
```

### Complication Creation
```
AI: "Now for the Complication—what changed, or what problem emerged?

This should:
- Disrupt the stable situation
- Create tension or urgency
- Make the audience want to know 'what now?'

What's the change, problem, or opportunity that emerged?

[Collect complication]

Let's test this:
- Does this create real tension/urgency? ✓/✗
- Would this concern your audience? ✓/✗
- Is the disruption clear? ✓/✗"
```

### Question Formulation
```
AI: "Given this complication, what question does your audience now have?

This might be:
- What should we do about this?
- Why is this happening?
- How can we solve this?
- What does this mean for us?

What's the natural question arising from: [complication]?

[Help formulate clear question]

This question sets up your answer perfectly."
```

### Answer Delivery
```
AI: "Now, your Answer—this is your main message or recommendation.

It should:
- Directly address the question
- Be clear and specific
- Be something you can support with evidence

What's your answer to [question]?

[Refine answer]

This becomes the top of your pyramid structure. Your supporting arguments will explain WHY this is the right answer."
```

### Complete SCQA Review
```
AI: "Here's your complete SCQA structure:

**SITUATION (Stable baseline):**
[Situation statement]

**COMPLICATION (Disruption/tension):**
[Complication statement]

**QUESTION (What this raises):**
[Central question]

**ANSWER (Your recommendation):**
[Main message]

Does this flow logically? Does each part naturally lead to the next? Any adjustments needed?"
```

### Supporting Structure
```
AI: "Now that we have your SCQA setup, let's build the supporting structure.

Your ANSWER will be supported by 3-5 key arguments. What are the main reasons this answer is correct?

[Transition to Pyramid Principle structure]"
```

## Example Use Cases

### Product Launch Decision
- **S**: Our flagship product has dominated the mid-market segment for 5 years
- **C**: New entrants are targeting enterprise clients with features we don't have
- **Q**: Should we move upmarket, and if so, how?
- **A**: We should develop an enterprise version, launching in Q4

### Process Improvement Proposal
- **S**: Our customer support team handles 500 tickets/week with 24-hour response time
- **C**: Ticket volume has doubled in 3 months, response time is now 72 hours, satisfaction dropped 30%
- **Q**: How do we handle the increased volume without sacrificing quality?
- **A**: Implement AI-powered triage and expand the team by 5 people

### Investment Recommendation
- **S**: We've invested in domestic equities with 8% annual returns
- **C**: Inflation is now 6%, our real returns are only 2%, below our 4% target
- **Q**: How should we adjust our portfolio to beat inflation?
- **A**: Shift 30% of portfolio to international equities and inflation-protected securities

### Technology Adoption
- **S**: Our development team uses manual testing processes, taking 2 days per release
- **C**: Competitors ship daily, we're losing market responsiveness and developer morale is declining
- **Q**: Should we invest in test automation, and what's the best approach?
- **A**: Implement CI/CD with automated testing over the next quarter

## Variations and Alternatives

### SCR (Situation-Complication-Resolution)
- Same as SCQA but skips explicit Question
- Moves directly to Resolution
- Slightly faster, less formal

### SCQRA (adds Rationale)
- **S**: Situation
- **C**: Complication
- **Q**: Question
- **R**: Resolution/Recommendation
- **A**: Arguments/support
- More explicit about structure

### SCA (Simplified)
- Drops Question entirely
- **S**: Situation
- **C**: Complication
- **A**: Answer
- For very quick communications

## Tips for Success
- **Situation should be boring**: If it's already interesting, it's not stable baseline
- **Complication creates urgency**: This is what makes audience care
- **Question might be implicit**: You don't always state it explicitly
- **Answer should resolve tension**: Directly addresses the complication
- **Keep it concise**: SCQA is setup, not the whole presentation
- **Test on colleagues**: Does the flow feel natural?
- **Adjust for audience**: Executives need brief S/C, technical audiences might need more

## Common Pitfalls
- **Situation is too long**: Get to complication quickly
- **Complication is weak**: Not enough tension/urgency created
- **Multiple complications**: Keep focus on one main tension point
- **Question doesn't match complication**: Logical disconnect
- **Answer doesn't resolve complication**: Misaligned solution
- **Too much detail in SCQA**: This is just the introduction

## Combining with Other Frameworks

### SCQA + Pyramid Principle (Very Common)
```
SCQA sets up the narrative:
├─ Situation (context)
├─ Complication (problem)
├─ Question (what to do?)
└─ Answer (your recommendation)

Then Pyramid structure explains the answer:
Answer (top of pyramid)
├─ Supporting Argument 1
│   ├─ Evidence A
│   └─ Evidence B
├─ Supporting Argument 2
└─ Supporting Argument 3
```

### SCQA + Storytelling Arc
- **S**: Exposition (introducing the world)
- **C**: Rising action (conflict emerges)
- **Q**: Climax (key question posed)
- **A**: Resolution (your solution)
- Supporting details: Falling action

## Industry Usage
- **McKinsey, BCG, Bain**: Standard framework for client presentations
- **Corporate strategy**: Common in strategic planning documents
- **Product management**: Structuring product proposals
- **Sales**: High-level pitch structure
- **Journalism**: "Inverted pyramid" is similar (but answer-first)

## Tailoring for Different Audiences

### Executive Audience
- **Situation**: 1-2 sentences max
- **Complication**: Focus on business impact
- **Question**: Often implicit
- **Answer**: Upfront and clear
- Move quickly to answer

### Technical Audience
- **Situation**: More detail on technical context
- **Complication**: Specific technical challenges
- **Question**: More nuanced, technical
- **Answer**: May include technical approach

### External Stakeholders
- **Situation**: Ensure shared understanding (they know less context)
- **Complication**: Frame in terms of their concerns
- **Question**: What matters to them
- **Answer**: Emphasize their benefits

## Key Principle
> "The SCQA framework transforms information into narrative, and narrative creates engagement."

Facts alone rarely persuade. But facts embedded in a story—with context, tension, and resolution—are compelling and memorable.
